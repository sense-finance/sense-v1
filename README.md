The Sense Protocol is a decentralized fixed-income protocol on Ethereum, allowing users to manage risk through fixed rates and future yield trading on existing yield bearing-assets.

Extensive documentation and use cases are available within this README and in the Sense docs [here](https://docs.sense.finance/).

One way to interact with Sense is through our official [app](https://app.sense.finance/eth-mainnet/rates)

Active development occurs in this repository, which means some contracts in it might not be production-ready. Proceed with caution.

## Development

This repo uses [Foundry: forge](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) for development and testing
and git submodules for dependency management (we previously used `dapp` and `nix`, so there are vestiges from those tools around).

To install Foundry [Foundry: Forge](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry), use the instructions in the linked repo.

In addition, this repo uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as our command runner:

```sh
brew install just
# or
cargo install just
```

### Test

```bash
# Get contract dependencies
git submodule update --init --recursive
yarn isntall # or npm install

# Run local tests
just turbo-test-local

# Run mainnet fork tests
just turbo-test-mainnet
```

### Format

```bash
# Run linter
yarn lint

# Run formatter
yarn fix
```

### Deploy

This repo uses [hardhat deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) for replicable deployments. To create a new deployment:

```bash
# Navigate to the `deployments` package
cd pkg/deployments

# Deploy the protcol with mocks on a forked network
yarn deploy:hardhat-fork:sim

# Deploy the protcol with production config on a forked network
yarn deploy:hardhat-fork:sim

# Deploy the protcol with mocks on a live network
yarn hardhat deploy --network <network> --tags scenario:simulated

# Deploy the protcol with production config on a live network
yarn hardhat deploy --network <network> --tags scenario:prod
```

### Environment

1. Create a local `.env` file in the root directory of this project
2. Set `ALCHEMY_KEY` to a valid Alchemy API key
3. Set `MNEMONIC` to a valid seed phrase for deployments

## Security

Sense contracts have gone through different independent security audits performed by [Fixed Point Solutions (Kurt Barry)](https://github.com/fixed-point-solutions), [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com), [ABDK](https://www.abdk.consulting/) and [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com). Reports are located in the [`audits`](./audits) directory.

### Bug Bounties

Sense has an active bug bounty on ImmuneFi, with up to $50,000 for reporting a bug. All of Sense's deployed contracts & Sense Portal are in scope for the bug bounty.

## Conventions

### Branching

Right now, we are using `dev` and  `main` branches.

- `main` represents the contracts live on `mainnet` and all testnets
- `dev` is for the newest version of contracts, and is reserved for deployments to `goerli`

When a new version of the contracts makes its way through the testnet, it eventually becomes promoted in `main`, with [semver](https://semver.org/) reflecting contract changes in the `major` or `minor` portion of the version (depending on backwards compatibility).
