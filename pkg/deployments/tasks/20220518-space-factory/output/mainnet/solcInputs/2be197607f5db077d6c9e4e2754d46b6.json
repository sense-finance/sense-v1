It handles updates,\n * encoding, and decoding of samples.\n *\n * Each sample holds the timestamp of its last update, plus information about three pieces of data: the price pair, the\n * price of BPT (the associated Pool token), and the invariant.\n *\n * Prices and invariant are not stored directly: instead, we store their logarithm. These are known as the 'instant'\n * values: the exact value at that timestamp.\n *\n * Additionally, for each value we keep an accumulator with the sum of all past values, each weighted by the time\n * elapsed since the previous update. This lets us later subtract accumulators at different points in time and divide by\n * the time elapsed between them, arriving at the geometric mean of the values (also known as log-average).\n *\n * All samples are stored in a single 256 bit word with the following structure:\n *\n * [    log pair price     |        bpt price      |       invariant       |  timestamp ]\n * [ instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator |            ]\n * [  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |    uint31  ]\n * MSB                                                                                LSB\n *\n * Assuming the timestamp doesn't overflow (which holds until the year 2038), the largest elapsed time is 2^31, which\n * means the largest possible accumulator value is 2^21 * 2^31, which can be represented using a signed 53 bit integer.\n */\nlibrary Samples {\n    using WordCodec for int256;\n    using WordCodec for uint256;\n    using WordCodec for bytes32;\n\n    uint256 internal constant _TIMESTAMP_OFFSET = 0;\n    uint256 internal constant _ACC_LOG_INVARIANT_OFFSET = 31;\n    uint256 internal constant _INST_LOG_INVARIANT_OFFSET = 84;\n    uint256 internal constant _ACC_LOG_BPT_PRICE_OFFSET = 106;\n    uint256 internal constant _INST_LOG_BPT_PRICE_OFFSET = 159;\n    uint256 internal constant _ACC_LOG_PAIR_PRICE_OFFSET = 181;\n    uint256 internal constant _INST_LOG_PAIR_PRICE_OFFSET = 234;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Updates a sample, accumulating the new data based on the elapsed time since the previous update.
